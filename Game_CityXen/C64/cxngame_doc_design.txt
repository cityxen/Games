GAME PLAY

Objective:
    Gather items, and put them in the associated LOCATIONs.
    Activate the LOCATIONs.
    Each LOCATION will not be able to be activated until level requirements are met.
    Each LOCATION will have a LIGHT above it.
        If it is RED that means it has not been activated.
        If it is YELLOW that means level requirements are met, but not activated.
        If it is GREEN that means it is activated.
    Once all LOCATIONs have been activated the level is completed.

LOCATIONs:
    WORKSTATION:    
        This is where you will bring PARTs.
        The WORKSTATION can be activated when all PARTs are gathered.
        Activation Action: ASSEMBLE - Stand in front of the WORKSTATION and press UP

    VINTAGE_COMPUTER:
        This is where you will bring DISKs.
        The VINTAGE_COMPUTER can be activated when the proper DISK is inserted.
        Activation Action: PROGRAM - Stand in front of the VINTAGE_COMPUTER and press UP

    PC:
        The PC status will change from RED to YELLOW once the WORKSTATION and VINTAGE_COMPUTER are activated.
        Activation Action: UPLOAD - Stand in front of the PC and press UP
                                    (This well be the end of level action and will be on every level)

INVENTORY:
    Shown at the right hand side of the screen
    Can store up to 10 items
    Slot 1 is reserved for Video Camera, which is the first thing you will get on the first level

HATERS:
    The HATERS are as followed:
        GREMLINs    - Invisible. The cause things to happen that are not supposed to happen.
        CURMUDGEONs - Rude people making comments on your videos.
                      When this happens, the PC LOCATION will flash dark red, and a intermittent BEEP BEEP will sound.
                      This will cause you not to be able to GET or PUT items, and it must be dealt with.
                      You will have to go to the PC and press UP to block them.
                      Once the CURMUDGEON has been blocked, the PC LOCATION will no longer flash.
        CLONE       - Miss DOS clone that somehow got into the studio.
                      In order to deal with this, the PLAYER will have to use the character special ability near it.


    These are the enemies that you will have to contend with in the levels.        

=========================================================================
LEVEL PERFORMANCE SCREEN:

    When you complete a level, it will transition to the LEVEL PERFORMANCE SCREEN.
    This will show some stats, and a score.
    Based on your performance of certain things,
     unknown algorithms (random stuff)
    the score will either increase or decrease.
    It will display each metric one line at a time and increase (or decrease) with beep noise. (Think end of level on Galaga)

               LEVEL COMPLETED!
              
               CONGRATULATIONS
